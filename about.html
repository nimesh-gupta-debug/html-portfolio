<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Nimesh Gupta, a BCA student at CKPCMC with a strong interest in coding and web technologies.
   I enjoy creating and hosting websites, and I love learning how the full process works—from writing code to putting a site live on the internet.</p>

<h2>My studies</h2> 

<p>I am currently studying Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) at CKPCMC,where I learn subjects like web designing, C++, data structures, databases, and basic statistics.
 These subjects help me build a solid base in programming and computer science concepts that I can use in real projects.</p>

<h2>My passion for coding</h2>

<p>I love to code and experiment with different technologies, especially for web development. Working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Bootstrap excites me because I can turn ideas into working web pages and improve them step by step.
</p>
<h2>Hosting and projects</h2>
<p>I am also interested in hosting websites, not just developing them. I like understanding how servers, domains, and deployment work so that I can make my own projects accessible to others online.</p>
